            We worked in a group of four to design an interactive interface for a startup named Dropezy, a grocery delivery application in Indonesia. We started by scratching, extensively explored alternative designs, created an interactive APP interface, and conducted user testing to finalize our design.

                        <!-- <p>Dropezy is a grocery delivery application in Indonesia, which aims to provide fast, convenient, affordable and accessible delivery services. Dropezy differs from other shopping platforms in that it offers users an easy and convenient way to purchase daily needs online in smaller quantities, more frequently, and anytime. 
                            Therefore, our design goal was to make the "choose - purchase" process as simple and fast as possible.</p> -->

                                <li> Besides lightning-fast deliveries to our customers, Dropezy cares about the safety, health, and happiness of their <b>community</b>. </li>
                                <li> Dropezy embraced <b>transparency</b> and is <b>committed</b> to workplace safety and equal opportunity for women without a gender pay gap.</li>

                        <p>Our design aims to demonstrate the concepts of Dropezy, targeting a young, affluent group of people who live in urban and suburban areas, with regular online shopping habits and relatively high consumption, who are more receptive to online shopping.

                        <p>We are targeting a young, affluent group of people who live in urban and suburban area, with regular online shopping habits and relatively high consumption.

                        <p>
                        The younger demographic is generally more receptive to online shopping. It is inevitable that fast and convenient online shopping services will require relatively high labor, storage, and logistics costs, but these target users can afford and are willing to pay more than regular grocery shopping in return for the convenience and time saved.

            Each group member comes up with one possible design for Dropezy’s app. Our sketching is shown below. 
            The resulting design is diverse and substantially different, especially since every version has its priority.

            <div class="normal-text">
                <p>I believe that for shopping applications, images are more appealing to the users, so I mainly included visual elements on the main page I designed. 
                    I have a search bar on the main page so that users can go directly to the item with the search bar if they want to buy a specific item. Otherwise, users can find more things on the category page.  </p>
                </br>
                <p>For the account page, I included a section for saving items or purchased items, which would be helpful for users wishing to find what they previously bought. The account page also provides a list that contains settings such as payments, languages, or delivery addresses.</p>
                </br>
                <p>I had plus and minus signs for users to change the number of items to purchase for the cart page. I also display detailed billing information, including shipping and taxes so that users can keep track of costs. </p>
                </br>
                <p>Finally, I want to highlight that for a shopping application. I included many sections for advertisements and promotions.</p>

            <div class="normal-text">
                <p>In my design, I think the bottom navigation bar should display which page users are currently at. So I try to distinguish the selected/not selected state using different color icons. 
                    On the home page, a search bar can help users quickly locate the item they are searching for. </p>
                </br>
                <p>The products are all under subcategories so that users can first find the category and check for the things they want efficiently. 
                    In the category page, I add a filter that can help users filter out the things they don’t like.  </p>
                </br>
                <p>The “Mine” page is just a basic version of the mine page where users can browse their past orders and search for help from the agency if they find an issue with their order and want to return their items.</p>

                <p>My priority is to lead the user to choose and purchase, so I include all the selections on the home page, along with best sellers and seasonal offers. 
                    Also, the cart must be simple, straightforward, and cover all the essential information. Creating a list of liked items can also save time for faster and more repeatable service.

                <p>Every user has different needs. Users who purchase the same things over and over again can go to the past order page. 
                    Users can change their minds at the last moment and checkout without deleting some items they might want to get later. Users can purchase items from different stores and quickly trace their orders. 
                    Also, I think a recommendation section can better connect the Dropezy community.</p>

                    A “back” button is needed to supplement the way users can go back from the cart to other pages (the old version's only way is using the bottom tab) 
                </li>
                <li>
                    Cart should emphasize the total final price. It would be nice if our design can show the dynamic update of the items & the final price. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    We should add the “+”, “-” button to allows the users to increase / decrease items in cart

                    The bottom's recommendation session's title can lead to some confusion. It would be better if we use larger size title

        <div class="normal-text">
            Using our newly created, interactive interface, we conduct our usability test through a remote user testing service <a href="https://www.usertesting.com/">UserTesting.com</a>. 
            Below are the tasks we assigned to the users and our intentions.

                This is an interactive mockup(prototype) of a grocery shopping application - Dropezy, which is designed to deliver orders from groceries in 15 minutes. Notice that as this is not a real application, some parts might not fully function as expected. </p>
            <p style="margin:10px; ">
                Imagine you are a user who wants to buy some food.  <br>
                Please browse the application as you like, and purchase two boxes of cheese mac.
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>Please enter the application and purchase two boxes of Annie's Shells & White Cheddar Macaroni & Cheese.</li>
                <li>Please find and browse the recipe of “healthy salmon for lunch” and tell us how you like it</li>
                <li>Please explore the “following” feature and share your experience and thought with us</li>
                <li>Like the item “100% Pure pumpkin” and check the saved item in account page - my list session</li>

        <div class="normal-text">
            Our design strives to <b>achieve the company's original goals</b>, making Dropezy a <b>convenient and accessible</b> delivery tool and a <b>community</b> that cares. 
            The cart page clearly layouts the taxes, shipping costs, and total prices, which guarantees <b>transparency</b>. 
            We designed a favorite list, which allows users to <b>save time and effort</b> finding the item they want. 
            A community feature allows users to share their shopping experience, find good recipes from influencers and discuss the hottest topics. 
            Thus, Dropezy can better hear the voice of the users, select its products, and develop strategies to meet their <b>daily</b> needs.
