            We worked in a group of four to design an interactive interface for a startup named Dropezy, a grocery delivery application in Indonesia. We started by scratching, extensively explored alternative designs, created an interactive APP interface, and conducted user testing to finalize our design.

                            Therefore, our design goal was to make the "choose - purchase" process as simple and fast as possible.</p> -->

            Each group member comes up with one possible design for Dropezy’s app. Our sketching is shown below. 
            The resulting design is diverse and substantially different, especially since every version has its priority.

            <div class="normal-text">
                <p>I believe that for shopping applications, images are more appealing to the users so I included mostly visual elements on the main page I designed. 
                    I included a search bar on the main page so that if users want to buy a specific item, they can go directly to the item with the search bar. Otherwise, users can find more items on the category page. </p>
                </br>
                <p>For the account page, I included a section for saving items or purchased items, which I think would be useful for users wishing to find what they previously bought. The account page also includes a list that contains settings such as payments, languages, or delivery addresses.</p>
                </br>
                <p>For the cart page, I had plus and minus signs for users to change the number of items to purchase. I also displayed detailed billing information including shipping and taxes so the users can keep track of costs.</p>
                </br>
                <p>Finally, I want to highlight that for a shopping application, I included many sections for advertisements and promotions.</p>

                <p>In my design, I think the bottom navigation bar should display which page users are currently at. So I try to distinguish the selected/not selected state using different color icons. 
                    In the home page, a search bar can help users quickly locate the item they are searching for. </p>
                </br>
                <p>The products are all under sub categories so that users can first find the category and check for the things they want efficiently. 
                    In the category page, I add a filter which can help users filter out the things they don’t like. </p>
                </br>
                <p>The “Mine” page is just a basic version of mine page where users can browse their past orders and search for help from the agency if they find an issue with their order and want to return their items.</p>

                    Also, the cart must be simple, straightforward, and cover all the essential information. Creating a list of liked items can also reduce search and selection time for a faster and more repeatable service.

On the cart, users who usually change their minds at the last moment can select the items they want to buy and checkout without deleting other things they might like. Users who wish to purchase items from different stores can quickly trace their orders respectively. 
                    It contains a recommendation section that aims to connect the <b>Dropezy community</b>. </p>

                    Screen change in size 
                </li>
                <li>
                    It would be better if the bottom tab can show which page is currently on
                </li>
                <li>
                    Icon, text and margin/padding should be standardized
                </li>

                    Text is too small

            <h5 class="h5-category">Cart page:</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    It would be better if users can go directly into the cart and back from the cart. 
                    A “back” button is needed to supplement the way users can go back from the cart to other pages (the old version's only way is using the bottom tab) 
                </li>
                <li>
                    Cart should emphasize the total final price. It would be nice if our design can show the dynamic update of the items & the final price. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    We should add the “+”, “-” button to allows the users to increase / decrease items in cart
                </li>
                <li>
                    Nice if there is indication of what items is in the cart

                    Cart's delivery date session is a little bit confusing

                <li>
                    The bottom's recommendation session's title can lead to some confusion. It would be better if we use larger size title
                </li>
                <li>
                    In some pages (i.e. home page), don't know how to open the cart, the right top button is too small

        <div class="normal-text">
            Using our newly created, interactive interface, we conduct our usability test through a remote user testing service <a href="https://www.usertesting.com/">UserTesting.com</a>. 
            Below are the tasks we assigned to the users and our intentions.

        <h4 class="h4-category">User Test Tasks:</h4>

        <!--Todo: maybe add some style?-->
        <!-- <div class="normal-text">
             <p style="margin:10px; ">
                This is an interactive mockup(prototype) of a grocery shopping application - Dropezy, which is designed to deliver orders from groceries in 15 minutes. Notice that as this is not a real application, some parts might not fully function as expected. </p>
            <p style="margin:10px; ">
                Imagine you are a user who wants to buy some food.  <br>
                Please browse the application as you like, and purchase two boxes of cheese mac.
            </p>

            <ol>
                <li>Please enter the application and purchase two boxes of Annie's Shells & White Cheddar Macaroni & Cheese.</li>
                <li>Please find and browse the recipe of “healthy salmon for lunch” and tell us how you like it</li>
                <li>Please explore the “following” feature and share your experience and thought with us</li>
                <li>Like the item “100% Pure pumpkin” and check the saved item in account page - my list session</li>

                <p style="margin-bottom:2%; margin-top:2%">We have three users showing quite different results. The first user performed okay with our prototyping. The second user, as an experienced grocery shopping app user, performed almost perfect as we expected. 
                    The third user encountered the most problems. All of them made valuable suggestions to our prototyping.</p>

                <p>Things that can be improved:</p>
                <ul style="margin-bottom:2%">
                    <li>Implementation of the search bar</li>
                    <li>Implementation of the “like/add to saved item” button on the home page</li>
                    <li>Solve the navigation issue from recipe to following page</li>
                    <li>Display the number of items added to the cart on home/category page and also give the users the option to modify the amount of items added to the cart</li>
                    <li>Style of the follow button</li>

        <div class="normal-text">
            Our design strives to achieve the company's original goals, making Dropezy a <b>convenient and accessible</b> delivery tool and a <b>community</b> that cares. 
            The cart page clearly layouts the taxes, shipping costs, and total prices, which guarantees <b>transparency</b>. 
            We designed a favorite list, which allows users to <b>save time and effort</b> finding the item they want. 
            A community feature allows users to share their shopping experience, find good recipes from influencers and discuss the hottest topics. 
            Thus, Dropezy can better hear the voice of the users, select its products, and develop strategies to meet their <b>daily</b> needs.
